/**
 * Shuriken's queue of Kiln builds. Kiln itself queues nothing: every brief starts a turn at once, each
 * open project is one Blender, and every Blender renders and bakes on the same GPU, so the caller is the
 * only limit (Kiln's docs/INTEGRATION.md). A build is one copilot turn on one Kiln project plus bringing
 * its result in; builds wait first in, first out, at most `kilnBuildsAtOnce` run, and two builds of the
 * same Kiln project never run together.
 *
 * The limit is the user's (Settings, 1-32, default 8), with two safety rules. Against a Kiln older than
 * 0.8.2 it is at most 6, whatever the setting: that Kiln doesn't gate simultaneous GPU work, and 12
 * Blenders rendering at once froze a PC with an 8 GB graphics card (2026-10-01). Kiln 0.8.2 lets only 3
 * renders or bakes run at the same moment itself, so there the setting applies as given. And the queue
 * steps its own limit DOWN on evidence of LOAD only (Kiln refusing briefs with 503 busy, builds queuing
 * for Kiln's GPU gate, bakes slowing sharply while several run) and says so in one line. A build that
 * failed is not load: builds that failed one after another because Kiln's login was out of usage once
 * stepped the limit down to 1 while Kiln sat idle. Failures from logins, usage limits or a Kiln that is
 * down never step it down. It steps back up by itself, doubling after every 5 quiet minutes, and the
 * user's (or the director's) setting clears a step-down at once.
 *
 * A build runs to its end whether or not an agent waits for it, so a modeler can queue several and wait
 * for all of them in one call, instead of one agent sitting idle per build.
