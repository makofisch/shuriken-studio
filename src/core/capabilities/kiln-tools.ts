      "Asks Kiln's own copilot for a RESULT: a new build, a rework, a fix or an animation of one of this game's models (model), or of a FAMILY of parts that must fit together or match (family + models: ONE Kiln project, each model its own in the game). Every model of the game is built this way. Kiln owns how: it researches the subject on the web, models, textures, rigs and animates in Blender, and already knows the Roblox rules (plain PBR, budgets, studs scale, the lighting of this place), so you ask for what the game needs and never for the method; the user watches it in the Kiln dock. If Kiln is installed but not running, this starts it. Write the text SHORT, as a result to a senior artist: what it IS, what it is for or how it is seen, and one phrase for its look; plus the facts the game's code depends on (which way is front, clip names and which loop, event markers such as Strike and Hit, ground speeds you want told back). One or two sentences make the best prop: Kiln's best quick build came from 178 characters in about a minute. Never repeat in the text what a field carries (size, sockets, parts, a family's models, style) or the game's premise, and give no part lists, per-part sizes, colours, materials, triangle counts, must-have lists, joint angles or steps: a method that would give a worse result is replaced. Example: \"Maze Runner Griever (2014 film), the maze's hunter: wet slug flesh on tall mechanical legs. Clips Idle, Walk, Run (loops; tell me ground speeds), Lunge (Strike and Hit markers), Roar\". kind: \"new\" (default when this call makes the Kiln project), \"rework\" (a different or better version of what exists), \"fix\" (change only what is wrong: put Studio screenshots of the asset in its real place in images (roblox_screenshot saves them under .shuriken/evidence) and say in one sentence what is wrong), \"animate\" (clips for an existing model). effort: leave it out so Kiln picks it from the brief; choose \"max\" only for a detailed hero build that truly needs it. references: the specific existing subject, as a few words (Kiln researches it first). images: reference pictures or Studio screenshots (project files or https URLs). sockets: where parts join, as names and constraints, never coordinates (Kiln places them and their positions come back in the result, the game's spec and the ShurikenSockets module). fits: families built earlier that this one must fit (Kiln brings their parts in). style: the game's shared look, kept for every later build. spec-like fields (tris, size, grounded, sockets) are checked by Kiln itself when the build ends (Kiln 0.8.2): the result's failedChecks and a family's problems are the ground for a fix. mode says what to do about a build of the same model that is still running: \"interject\" puts a correction into it without restarting it, \"queue\" (default) makes follow-on work wait its turn, \"replace\" stops it and starts over. Builds run in Shuriken's queue: several at once, the rest first in, first out. By default the call waits for the build and returns Kiln's reply, the effort it used and why, the delivery (size, units, objects, tris, joints, clips with length, loop, speed and markers, renders), what came into the game (parts, rig, clips; for a family each model with its size and socket positions, and problems: what the build still owes the game) and what it cost. Read facts there instead of guessing, and do not retune the result yourself: a result that is wrong gets another kiln_request (kind fix). Several builds: pass wait false to each (it returns the build's id at once), then kiln_builds {wait: true} waits for all of them in one call, so nothing sits idle per build. Kiln before 0.7.3 gets the same goals with Shuriken's Roblox notes added to the text.",
