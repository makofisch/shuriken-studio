 * The director looks before it answers. The user asked four questions about a finished mech arena (session
 * 2026-10-01_16-08-08): which Studio file the project is linked to, whether the game saves and is ready to publish,
 * what is wrong with the mobile UI ("don't take any actions"), and how Studio splits phones from desktops. Each was
 * answered in seconds from general knowledge, one of them wrongly ("no touch controls that I've seen": three
 * finished tasks had added them). Here the same four messages reach a director that has the facts in its state
 * and read-only tools to look further; the tests assert on what it is given and what it may call, not on prose.
